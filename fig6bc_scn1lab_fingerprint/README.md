Main script is MATLAB script `Vp_Analyse_fingerprint.m`, which takes three mat files as input (in that order):
* *140218_34_DATA.mat* (same as in folder **scn1lab_stable**)
* *190813_06_DATA.mat* (same as in folder **scn1lab_f0**)
* *190813_07_DATA.mat* (same as in folder **scn1lab_f0**)

It generates files:
* *exptags.csv*
* *grptags.csv*
* *fingerprint.csv*
* *eucdists.csv*

*exptags.csv*; *grptags.csv*; *fingerprint.csv* are input to script `fingerprint.R`, which generates the fingerprint plot and the correlation heatmap in Figure 6B (*f0_fingerprint.pdf*, *f0_corrheat.pdf*).

*exptags.csv*; *grptags.csv*; *eucdists.csv* are input to script `euclideanscatter.R`, which generates the Euclidean distance scatterplot in Figure 6C (*f0_eucdist.pdf*). It also performs statistical tests.

Plot in Figure 6B is generated by script `fingerprint.R`  
Plot in Figure 6C is generated by script `euclideanscatter.R`

`euclideanscatter.R` also calculates the statistics reported in the text (including the Z-test on effect sizes).
